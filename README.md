# 🚀 GFGsolution

A futuristic, curated collection of my C++ solutions to DSA problems — mostly solved on
**GeeksforGeeks**. This repo is my neon dojo: I iterate on solutions, tighten complexity,
and keep code readable for real-world interviews.

---

## 🌱 Why this exists
This repo documents my daily grind to become a stronger problem solver:
- Strengthen core DSA fundamentals
- Keep solutions consistent and readable
- Track steady progress and learning
- Build interview-ready intuition

Every solved problem is a small upgrade to the system.

---

## ✨ What you'll find
Organized, lean C++ solutions across common patterns:
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Stacks & Queues
- Dynamic Programming & Greedy
- Backtracking & Recursion
- Sliding Window / Two Pointers
- Bit Manipulation
- Searching & Sorting
- Classic GeeksforGeeks patterns

Each file prefers clarity first, micro-optimizations second.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Language: C++
- Platform: GeeksforGeeks
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code / GFG IDE

---

## 🌟 Coding Philosophy
- Logic > clever hacks
- Clean, well-commented solutions
- Identify patterns, then generalize
- Small improvements compound into mastery

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Master DSA concepts deeply
- Produce interview-ready solutions
- Keep solutions readable under time pressure
- Document the learning path clearly

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
An aspiring coder leveling up daily—solving problems, refining logic, and evolving
like a cyberpunk tuning their internal systems. If you're grinding DSA too, welcome
to the squad. ⚡
